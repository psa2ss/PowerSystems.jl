# # Adding additional fields
#
# All components currently implemented in `PowerSystems.jl` have an `ext` field that contains
# an empty `Dictionary`. This empty dictionary can be accessed with the method `get_ext`.
#shows an example of adding additional data to the [`ThermalStandard`](@ref) structs for other
# modeling requirements.

# This method is useful if there is no requirement to create new behaviours for components of
# a particular type but additional fields are required. A simple example is the addition of geographic information if needed.
